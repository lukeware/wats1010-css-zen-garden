#CSS Zen Garden Design Description

WATS 1010-1 WQ16

By Luke Ware 

 

The primary function of my wireframe was to decide how to
layout content. There are a total of nine primary elements given to us in the
HTML file and I wanted to group them together in the must logical way possible
for me. Since there is so little content, I opted not to include space for any
primary site navigation or page anchors. This indicates to visitors that the
contents of the page are short and the text and design are the primary focus
for their attention. I chose the two-column design because I felt that having
one single column made the page too long and would likely have required a
navigation menu. Not having the page as long also decreases the appearance of
too much text for me. 

 

When the user visits my CSS Zen Garden, I hope to convey a simplistic,
eloquent and playful tone. I intend to integrate softer colors of a similar
palette to differentiate between content areas as they are roughly outlined in
the wireframe.  These will be partially
transparent over textured background. Using subtle color like this will help
draw the users eye to flow through each element. Similarly, I want the header
and footer to complement each other so that they demark the start and finish of
the content.  I have opted to place the “Select
a Design” in the bottom left footer because I felt that in terms of flow, the
last thing the person should do before leaving my page is pick the next CSS Zen
Garden to visit. 

 

For my main image, I want to use something playful like a
photograph of a Lego character in some tall grass in my backyard. This will
convey that CSS is very playful and allows for a lot of creativity. The loose Lego
theme also fits with my content which is blocked out in various colors.
Similarly, I have chosen to use san-serif fonts as serif fonts tend to create a
more rigid, serious feeling compared of the refined yet playful look I am going
for.

I really liked the playfulness of “[A Robot Names Jimmy](http://csszengarden.com/215/)” and the use of
color and texture in “[A Walk In the
Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/206/). ” The use of the timeline in “[pret-a-porter](http://www.csszengarden.com/037/)” is also stunning.
